    //INSTANCE VARIABLES

    //You need a constructor with two paramters
    //    a String that contains the account type name "savings" or "checking"
    //    a double that contains the initial balance
    //the constructor should initialize the "accountType" and "balance"
    //instance variables
 

    //GETTER METHOD
    //You need a getter method for the instance variable "balance" called "getBalance"
    //It should return the balance
 


    // METHOD deposit(double amount)
    //should deposit an amount into the  account object (rounded to the nearest tenth!)
    //it should not deposit an amount into the account if the account is overdrawn

    //you should create additional methods that allow you to re-use code. Suggestions below:
    //a checkBalance method
